# Air Quality Index Prediction 
### with end to end deployment



## Features

- The project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting the air quality index based on various environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and particulate matter.
- The project will use an automated machine learning tool called TPOT, which will assist in the selection of the best machine learning algorithm and feature set for the prediction model.
- The project will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation, and optimization using TPOT to generate the best possible predictive model for the air quality index.
